# Visual-Odometry-Pipeline-in-Python
Visual Odometry Pipeline implemenation in Python


### Aim of the Project
Inspired from (Kornia)[https://kornia.github.io/], aims to implement common functions in Geometric Computer Vision and apply to  Structure from Motion for 3D Recontruction

### Why Pytorch ?

Yet to Write

### Tasks
[] Dataloader for Kitti Dataset
[] Common util functions in epipolar Geomtry
[] Benchmark Speed Tests with OpenCV implementation
[] Implement Monocular Visual Odomentry (avisingh's super popular UG project at IIT Kanpur)
